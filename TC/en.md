When you share messages referring to the App, UGent and In The Pocket have the right to use these. This applies, among other things, to articles, text messages or tweets.

You indemnify UGent and In The Pocket against all possible claims by third parties as a result of acting in violation of these Terms of Use.

It is up to you to look after the necessary hardware and software, peripherals and (internet) connections at your own expense to enable access to, and use of, the App and the User Account. As a User, you cannot claim any compensation for the use of the Data by UGent.
